                A statement credit is a positive amount on your credit card bill. If you accidentally overpay, most credit cards will apply a statement credit toward your future purchases. As mentioned above, some rewards programs also allow you to apply cash back to a statement credit, lowering your balance by using your cash rewards.

                Cash back is when the credit card company gives you a certain percentage of what you put on the card back in the form of rewards. Different programs offer different redemption options. You may be able to use it as a credit toward your current statement, to shop online, to purchase gift cards, or simply have it deposited back into a connected bank account. Discover allows card members to donate their cash back to a wide selection of non-profit organizations as well.

                Some programs have no expiration dates and you can earn and use rewards whenever it’s convenient for you. Others have annual programs with “use it or lose it” clauses requiring that you redeem rewards within a certain time period or else forfeit their value. Be sure to read your Credit Card Agreement to understand if and when rewards expire.
